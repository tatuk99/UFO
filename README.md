# UFO Challenge

## Overview of Analysis
This analysis was created in order to create an interactive webpage. As a result, it is possible to filter by multiple criteria in order to check out various UFO sightings. Date, city, state, country, and shape filtering are the result of this project.

## Results
Since the webpage now has these filters, it is easy to just input the specific parameters that are asked. Typing in the city, state, date, country and shape of the area will yield a list of UFO sightings with interesting comments. (In my case it didn't work all the way, wasn't able to figure out why).

## Summary
One issue is that you can't use a dropdown selector to select the specific parameters. That would make this tool much more user friendly than it is at the moment. Additionally, some people may have trouble spelling the specific locations, and there is no spellcheck or autofill that would solve that problem. I would recommend adding those things for the future.
